            <p><p>Hello, my name is Benjamin. Born and raised in Philadelphia. Recent graduate at Community College of
                Philadelphia under
                Associate of Art major in Culture, Science, and technology. A friend introduces me into coding and now
                attending the
                University Of Pennsylvania coding boot camp to get experiences and learn new skills. I love to read,
                travel, and do
                outdoors things. My guilty please is watching anime, binge on any shows online, and gym. YouTube, reddit,
                and Medium
                the three most three things I visit daily. Because youtube has ton of information you get, reddit and
                Medium are
                sources where I can get my knowledge and people experience.</p>
            <p>The one thing I can live without is bean spout because the
                taste makes me gag never like it when I was a child. Itâ€™s a pleasure to meet you all, and hopefully to meet
                you in person.</p>
